2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell data_counter_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) data_counter_reg[0]/CLR, data_counter_reg[1]/CLR, data_counter_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell saida_reg[7]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) saida_reg[0]/CLR, saida_reg[1]/CLR, saida_reg[2]/CLR, saida_reg[3]/CLR, saida_reg[4]/CLR, saida_reg[6]/CLR, saida_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
